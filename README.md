# Data Warehousing and BigQuery Learning Repository

Welcome to my learning repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey into the world of data warehousing, Google BigQuery, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and SQL. Here, you'll find my notes, examples, exercises, and projects as I learn and apply new concepts.

## Overview

This repository covers the following topics:

1. **Data Warehousing Concepts**
   - Star Schema
   - Snowflake Schema
   - Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)
   - Dimensions and Facts
   - Surrogate Keys

2. **Google BigQuery**
   - Creating and managing datasets and tables
   - Writing and running SQL queries in BigQuery
   - Data insertion and manipulation
   - Optimizing queries for performance

3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
   - Setting up a GCP account and using the Free Tier
   - Enabling BigQuery and other necessary APIs
   - Using Google Cloud Console for managing resources

4. **SQL for Data Analysis**
   - Basic SQL queries for data retrieval
   - Aggregation, joins, and subqueries
   - Advanced SQL techniques for data analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To follow along with the examples and exercises in this repository, you'll need the following:

- A Google Cloud Platform account. You can sign up for the [GCP Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free) to get started.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and databases.
- Access to Google BigQuery via the GCP Console.

### Setting Up GCP and BigQuery

1. **Create a GCP Account**: Sign up for a Google Cloud Platform account if you donâ€™t have one already.
2. **Activate Free Tier**: Use the $300 free credits and start with BigQuery and other services.
3. **Create a Project**: Set up your first project in the Google Cloud Console.
4. **Enable BigQuery API**: Make sure the BigQuery API is enabled for your project.

## Learning Plan

Over the next few days, I will be focusing on the following:

1. **Understanding Data Warehousing Concepts**:
   - In-depth study of star and snowflake schemas.
   - Learning how to model data for reporting and analytics.

2. **Hands-On Practice with BigQuery**:
   - Creating and managing datasets and tables.
   - Writing and optimizing SQL queries.
   - Performing complex data analysis and reporting.

3. **Exploring Advanced SQL Techniques**:
   - Learning about window functions, CTEs, and more.
   - Applying SQL best practices for performance.
